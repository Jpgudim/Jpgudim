Hi, I'm @Jpgudim. I am a college student getting a bachelor's degree in information systems with a minor in computer science.

I am pursuing a career in data engineering and analytics.

My main personal project that I am working on is my stock market dashboard.

Project details and plans:
- Python for data retrieval from Polygon API
- PostgresSQL database to store historical data
- Dash for data visualization
- Render for web hosting
