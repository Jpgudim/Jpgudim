Hi, I'm @Jpgudim. I am a college student currently studing a major in information systems and a minor in computer science.

Currently I am learning Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I am focusing on Python right now.

I hope to have a career in data analytics, software engineering, or other another path in the IT field.

My commits are just to keep track of my projects and see my progression over time.

Thanks!
